interface and server

interface will fork() -> execl() to start Server
Interface accepts commands from console and send them to server for execution
after server exeecutes command, it will send output to interface for display on console

Interface creates pipes before fork() - 2 pipes

Interface passes pipe file descriptor values to Server. Use arguments on exec for this

Interface should detect final exit status of the Server and show message

Server does 2 things before entering loop accepting commands
1. init array of structures using data in gasData file
2. show contents of the array to verify correct initialization
records keep track of gas consumption of cars
each structure consists of fields:
  - id - string of up to 8 chars
  - odometer - int
  - gallons - float
Use typedef for record structure

gasData - each line has data for 1 record FORMAT:
id odometer gallons
DELIMITER IS SINGLE SPACE

commands
1. mpg,id - average miles per gallon for ID car
2. list,id - list all entries by ID in increasing order of odometer reading
3. exit - server terminates. interface detects termination, prints relevant info and exits normally

Must have Makefile



USE: fork, some type of exec call (such as execl), pipe, read, write, exit, waitpid, close.
In addition your code is to check the response from the system calls for errors, display an appropriate error message and take appropriate action. In many cases that action may be just to call exit with a unique number selected.

USEFUL: strchr, strcmp, strncmp, strncpy
